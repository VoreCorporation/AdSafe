<p>We understand how important it is to be mobile. So if your vehicle is damaged or stolen, it’s important to have a policy that will get you back behind the wheel – and fast. Our approved repairer network, S.M.A.R.T repair shops and policies do just that. </p>

<p>With three levels of motor insurance cover — Comprehensive, Third party with fire & theft, and Third party only — you can choose the MotorPlan that’s right for you.</p>

<p><b>Comprehensive cover</b><br>
From a chip in your windscreen and replacement locks, to emergency accommodation and transport after an accident, this cover is extensive. It’s insurance that goes beyond simply repairing or replacing your vehicle. Benefits include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cleaning and valet costs following a break-in.</li>
	<li>Replacement keys and locks if they’ve been damaged, including proximity keys up to $1000.</li>
	<li>No excess when repairing damaged windscreen, sun-roof, windows, head or tail lights sustained without other damage to your vehicle. This will not affect your no claims discount either.</li>
	<li>Cover towards transport home or emergency accommodation following an accident if your vehicle can’t be driven.</li>
	<li>Legal liability cover for reparation and damages if you accidently cause injury to another person or damage to their vehicle or property as a result of an accident involving your vehicle.</li>
	<li>Repair guarantee—we guarantee the work of our nation-wide repairers for as long as you own the vehicle.</li>
	<li>If your vehicle is written off you may be eligible to have the unused premium credited to the policy of your replacement vehicle.</li>
	<li>We may replace your vehicle with a brand new vehicle if your car is under 12 months old, has travelled less than 15,000km and it is stolen or significantly damaged.</li>
	<li>Cover for trailers—own, hired or borrowed (doesn’t include campervan, caravan, horse or boat trailers).</li>
</ul>
