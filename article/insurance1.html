<p>Insurers want extra money from your pay packet, and usually, they get what they want. Seriously - take a look at your latest bill. Now look at the same one from a year ago. Are you paying more?</p>

<p>If the answer is ‘yes’, you may well wonder why.</p>

<p>Your insurer grows its stash of cash by automatically renewing your policy every year and charging you more for the pleasure. Sometimes the price hikes creep up on you, and other times it’s an in-your-face monster, devouring your hard-earned savings in one big gobble. <br> Chances are you’re here because you’ve noticed your premium change for the worst. You did the right thing - let’s get started.</p>

<p><b>Dare to compare</b><br>
Auto-renewal is lauded as ‘hassle-free’ - no thinking, or bother required, and astonishingly that’s a justification for loading on pounds, low-key. Shoppers - rise up! There’s no need to roll over and accept a hiked premium, or overpay for insurance, ever. Huge insurance savings are ripe for the picking, but only those who dare to compare, win.</p>

<p><b>Price versus policy</b><br>
It's not all about the money, money, money - you may also find that you get a policy that rocks your world and ticks the boxes, at a price you’re comfortable with. GoCompare built its name and reputation on its ground-breaking insurance comparison service, and this remains at the heart of everything we do. We were the first comparison site to focus on showing you the features of insurance policies as well as the price, and as we've developed our services the aim continues to be to find you the right product at the right price.</p>

<p>To help make your choices fair and simple, we've introduced features such as Defaqto product ratings - star-gradings of policies from an independent financial research company which is recognised and respected throughout the insurance world.</p>
